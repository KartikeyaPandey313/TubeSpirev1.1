    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to provide a simple, powerful, and reliable tool for users
      to save online video content for offline use. We envision a world where
      users have complete control over their media. TubeSpire is not just a
      tool; it's a step towards a more open and accessible internet, built on
      the power of open-source software and the freedom it provides to users and
      developers alike.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Technology</h2>
    <p>
      TubeSpire is built on a foundation of robust, open-source technology. We
      utilize the powerful `yt-dlp` Python libraryâ€”the gold standard for online
      video downloading. This allows us to support a wide range of formats and
      resolutions, including high-definition content up to 8K and beyond,
      ensuring what you see online is what you get on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      We take your privacy seriously. We do not require registration, and we do
      not log user activity. The video URLs you enter are processed ephemerally
      and are never stored long-term. For more details, please review our
      <a href="{{ url_for('privacy') }}">Privacy Policy</a>.
