    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to provide a simple, powerful, and reliable tool for users
      to save online video content for offline use. Whether you're a content
      creator or editor needing clips for a edit, a student saving educational
      lectures, or simply someone who wants to watch videos without an internet
      connection, our service is built to empower you.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Technology</h2>
    <p>
      TubeSpire is built on a foundation of robust, open-source technology. We
      utilize the powerful `yt-dlp` Python library, the gold standard for online
      video downloading. This allows us to support a wide range of formats and
      resolutions, including high-definition content up to 8K and beyond.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      We take your privacy seriously. We do not require registration, and we do
      not log user activity. The video URLs you enter are processed ephemerally
      and are never stored long-term. For more details, please review our
      <a href="{{ url_for('privacy') }}">Privacy Policy</a>.
